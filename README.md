🎯 Say goodbye to repetitive drag-and-drop drudgery!

Open File Mover is a simple Python script that lets you do three things:
1. **Move folders via the command line**
2. **Empty your recycle bin using the command line**
3. **Clear your downloads folder through the command line**

## Building Instructions in Three Easy Steps

1. **Install Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. **Install the winshell dependency**: You need the `winshell` package for this program to work. Install it by running `pip install winshell` in your terminal.
3. **Run the script**: Navigate to the `src` folder and execute `python main.py 'insert your command here'` to start using the tool.
